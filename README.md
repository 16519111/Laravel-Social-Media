<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great Social Media online, such as Instragram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. However, these mainstream social medias have become less and less accepting with what you have to say and what you actually believe. They have these policies which were intended to make their community safe, comfortable, and friendly, but in order to attain that, they have taken away some of your right for free speech.

LaraGram is here to solve your problem. Having no censorship policies, LaraGram users have complete freedom to express what they think in any ways they want to. By loosing all the barriers, great ideas that are not normally accepted in the mainstream space may rise and help even greater communities.
